Overview
This project implements the classic "FizzBuzz" programming challenge. Numbers are printed sequentially, replacing multiples of 3 with "fizz," multiples of 5 with "buzz," and multiples of both with "fizzBuzz."

Usage
Open the HTML file in a browser and enter a number when prompted. The FizzBuzz sequence will display in the browser's console.

Logic
The JavaScript function loops from 1 up to the input number, applying rules to print "fizz," "buzz," "fizzBuzz," or the number itself.

Technologies
HTML5, JavaScript

Customization
Extend the game by adding CSS styling or displaying output directly on the webpage.
